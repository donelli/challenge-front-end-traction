# TRACTIAN Challenge Back-End Full Stack 

## About

Whenever you imagine an application for industry, you definitely get the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthose very old and poorly organized screens. Yes, you figured it out! Fortunately, at TRACTIAN, we don't do that!. We think a lot about usability, and it's no wonder that our slogan is to ‚Äúmake the Maintenance Manager's life easier‚Äù. Well-made screens are always in your head, so don't go easy!

## Challenge

Build an application that shows all possible data and actions using the API created in the back-end challenge.

- Important:
- Show all features of assets;
- Show companies, units and users;
- Actions such as delegating responsibility, updating assets, company, unit and users;
- Use graphs to show health levels, status and so on.

Mandatory:
- Engine (React)
- Graphics (Highcharts)

Differentials:
- Typescript;
- Standard Projects (Clean Code/Clean Architecture);
- AntDesign React.

!!! Please, be able to abstract well the presented problem and define it yourself which data you consider most important. Think with the user's head: What does an industry person need to know about their assets?

In addition to the required libraries, you can use anything else and at the end publish your code on GitHub and deploy the application (Heroku suggestion) because we want to see it online, then send us the links. üî•
